# useRef project, React + Tailwindcss

## I've learnt useRef and was able to directly manipulate DOM with it, all though that might not be a good practice, but that's what useRef is for says ChatGPT, you can reference a particular dom node with it and make that value persist across renders without it triggering render itself.
## I used useRef here in order to select the whole password when the user clicks on the copy button to give him visual feedback.
